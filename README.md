# Flooded Gems

Flooded Gems is a digital adaptation of a physical board game I originally designed for a university project. This Unity-based version recreates the mechanics in an interactive format and serves as a personal exercise in improving gameplay logic, turn management, and code organization.

## Overview
Players take turns moving around a board, digging at "dig spots" for collectable gems, attempting to gather a full collection all the while managing the risk of random intermittent flooding. The project is designed to allow for a single player to player with up to 3 CPU players, but functionality for local multiplayer and a stretch goal of online multiplayer is planned.

## Technical Highlights
- **Engine:** Unity (C#)
- **Game Logic:** Turn manager, interactable UI, seperation of functionality   
- **UI:** Custom Unity UI setup for game interaction and representation of other players' actions 
- **Version Control:** Managed with Git and GitHub

## Development Notes
Flooded Gems has been an ongoing personal project where functions are being implemented slowly. Original art that was created for the physical version has been reused for sprites.

## Future Improvements
- Updated UI art assets
- Custom made music
- Local multiplayer
- Online multiplayer
